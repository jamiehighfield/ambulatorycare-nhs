# Team Working Agreement & Contributing

**These are the terms detailing the professional practice and management approach that we agree to abide by as a team.**

When contributing to this project, please follow the guidelines below.

## Collaborative Working

### Guidelines

When working together, please follow the guidelines below:

- Respect each other's ideas and thoughts and don't interrupt other people.
- Don't delete other developer's branches, except in case where:
	- you have prior authorisation from the developer
- Use the group's GitLab project and task board.
- Be on time to agreed meetings (see below), and where this is not possible, please ensure that you inform other team members using the agreed communication channels.
- The agreed communication channels for this project are:
	- Microsoft Teams, and
	- Messenger.
- Each sprint for the project will be 1 week, starting on each Friday.

### Task Boards

It is agreed that Taiga will be used for overall project management. The Friday morning meeting will be used to setup user stories and tasks for the preceding sprint. These should be kept up-to-date throughout the week.

### Meeting Schedule

As a team, we agree to meet up during the following times and in the following locations:

-   Every Tuesday – morning (AM) – National Software Academy, Newport.
-   Every Thursday – all day – Cardiff or National Software Academy, Newport.
-   Every Friday – morning (AM) - National Software Academy, Newport.
-   Every other Friday – afternoon (PM) - starting on February 8th  2019, we will meet the client at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

A stand-up/progress meeting every morning on Thursday at 10:30, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are academic constraints preventing this.

- We agree that during each meeting we will have stand-ups explaining what we have done, what we plan to work on next and any impediments that have occurred.
- We agree to communicate every day to determine what has been done when necessary and/or alert other members of any issues.
- It is agreed that work should be avoided on weekends where at all possible in direct relation to the project. Work carried out on a Monday or Wednesday should be entered in to the daily scrumb file in Microsoft Teams for the next available day.

## Methodologies

We agree to perform daily stand-up meetings where each team member will outline what they have done since the last meeting, problems encountered and what they are planning to work on until the next meeting. This is an Agile Methodology which we will implement into our team work; making sure we work together effectively and efficiently.

## Communication

As a team, we agree to use Microsoft Teams and Facebook as our forms of communication to share and save code.

We agree to use a GitLab Repository and the Microsoft Teams group that have been setup for the project.

We agree that we will be using Taiga for project management to clearly organise and display what each team member is doing, what needs to be done and what has been completed.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack will be agreed in due course when further information about the project proposal is known. It is likely; however, to form a combination of some of the following technologies/languages:

- C# (ASP .NET Core) controller, service and repository layer,
- Java (Spring Boot) controller, service and repository layer,
- Angular front-end,
- React Native front-end,
- JavaScript,
- VueJS,
- ReactJS,
- MySQL for database functionality.

On the 12/02/2019, we agreed the following technology stack:

- Java (Spring Boot) controller, service and repository layer,
- React Native front-end,
- MySQL for database functionality

## Definition of Done

### Abstract

A definition of done is used to ensure that all conditions that this piece of software must satisfy, are met and are capable of being accepted by a user or customer of this piece of software. Ensuring that we follow the definition of done allows us to:

- Ensure high quality code or other contributions.
- Prevents the need for rework because the code or other contribution is not appropriate or is otherwise unsuitable.
- Ensures that time is not wasted reviewing or merging broken, incomplete or otherwise unsuitable.
- Prevents features not satisfying the needs of the user or customer of this piece of software being delivered.

### Definition

We consider our definition of done, suitable to this project to be:

- A new feature should be developed on a new branch ("feature branch") that either:
	- originates from master, or
	- has been merged from master as to ensure that it is up-to-date.
- The new branch should be re-based.
- Comprehensive automated tests should be created for any new features, mainly in areas where potentially 'destructive' changes to code are made, such as the service layer.
- A new merge request should be created with the target branch being 'master'.
- This should be reviewed by at least 1 other developer to ensure the following:
-   comprehensive automated tests have been created for any new features, and
-   potentially 'destructive' changes to code are checked, and
-   separation of concerns are obeyed, and
- Merge requests will be merged thereafter.

After a merge request has been merged, you should ensure that any task boards used have been updated accordingly.

## Merge Requests

We will use a branch structure in git to avoid merge conflicts. There will be feature branches which will be used to create individual features for the application and will be a duplicate of the development branch. All features will be merged into the development branch once they are working correctly with all the content already in there. The master branch will be updated every friday morning and will be merged with the working application in the development branch. Before merging each feature branch into the development branch, merge the development branch into the feature. This way you can check that everything in your feature branch is compatible with the development branch. When there are no issues, merge your feature branch into the development branch.

Approaching the end of every sprint, we agree to test the application developed during the week, to ensure that it is functioning as planned and expected. If everything meets the expected criteria then we agree to merge the development into the master branch. At the end of every sprint - every Friday - we will have Retrospectives to reflect on what we have done in the previous sprint and what we will do in the next sprint.

Under no circumstances should code be pushed straight to 'master' as this avoids code review and any accountability, except in cases where:

- There are legal pressing needs for code to be pushed straight to 'master' avoiding code review, such as GDPR considerations.

In these cases, a retrospective code review should take place by at least 1 developer.

Our working agreement complies with the CUESIP Code of Conduct for Student Group Projects, which explicitly states that all team members should seek, accept and offer honest criticism of technical work. It also states that each member of the team should acknowledge and correct errors in their technical work with the relevant authorization of the team.

## Amendments

Changes should be first agreed with the whole team. Last modified 01/03/2019.
